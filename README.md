 - Built this web app to learn about useState in React.
    - The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components.
    - useState and setState both are asynchronous. They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object. 
    - This is done to improve the performance of the rendering of React components. 
    - Even though they are asynchronous, the useState and setState functions do not return promises.
